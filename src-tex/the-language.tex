\PoemTitle{The Language-Eater}

\begin{verse}
He never entirely gave up talking\\
but early on he found in silence\\
his real passion.\\
He stood at the margin of conversations\\
and swallowed what he heard\\
-- a discreet\\
bottomless throat.

Often the others turned towards him\\
perplexed\\
when they noticed\\
they had already forgotten\\
what they had just talked about.

But he kept his silence, politely withdrawn\\
his eyes appearing to be occupied\\
with something in the distance.
\end{verse}
