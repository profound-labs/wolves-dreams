\PoemTitle{The Flies}

\begin{verse}
I found a soft seat of moss\\
between the roots of a larch.

Everything is silent,\\
apart from the wind in the trees,\\
birdsong\\
and the buzzing of persistent flies.

Sipping green tea from a thermos\\
I leaf through a book\\
of `life-affirming' poems,

picking it up and putting it down:

perhaps love is\\
to be alone\\
in a forest full of flies --

set free, longings and desires\\
disappear into the ferns and tall grasses\\
of a green horizon

and for the moment there remains only\\
the quiet poetry of what happens\\
between coming here\\
and going back where I came from.
\end{verse}
