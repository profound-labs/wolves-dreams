\begin{quote}
Solo la nieve sabe\\
la grandeza del lobo.

\hspace{2em}\textit{Leopoldo Mar√≠a Panero}
\end{quote}

\begin{verse}
Only the snow knows\\
the greatness of the wolf\\
that swallows our shadows

Only the void beneath the moon\\
understands his language\\
that reconciles like living water

Only the twisted pine\\
and the rock on which he lies\\
watch over his sleep

while the pain screams\\
and sunlight\\
wipes out the tracks
\end{verse}
