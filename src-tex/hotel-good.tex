\PoemTitle{Hotel Good Future}

\begin{verse}
In the \emph{Hotel Good Future} all rooms\\
are taken by homely utopias\\
Implants of conscience grow\\
like fungal infestations on the walls\\
spread the stink of mushroom-hearts

You escape into the walled garden\\
Here the stars sing like pinpricks\\
a fishbone shines\\
a blackbird stays silent\\
blinks at you\\
and regurgitates a cherry pip

In quite a different place\\
between Tigris and Euphrates\\
sprawls the flower carpet of leukaemia\\
Depleted uranium goes begging in the desert\\
three-eyed children bite back

You walk in circles in your garden\\
Here the stones sing like luminous bones\\
a fishbone shines\\
on the lid of the night
\end{verse}
