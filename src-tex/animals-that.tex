\PoemTitle{Animals That Visit Me at Night}

\begin{verse}
It's a long time since I dreamt of horses.

I dreamt of porcupines instead.\\
They were teeming fearlessly\\
like spiked rats\\
under the carpet.

And of frog-swallowing snakes.\\
They had an eye on you as well.\\
The frogs, in between the deadly fangs,\\
did not complain.

And of a scorpion.\\
It came black and rustling with a metal sound.\\
Every door I slammed between us\\
remained open just a gap.

And then there was the little bear.\\
It was sick, clinging\\
pathetically to my neck.\\
Whether it recovered, I do not know.

Finally, yesterday, the wolves arrived.

At dusk they settled quietly around me.\\
The big black one rested its muzzle\\
on my shoulder and looked at me.\\
So, together, we were safe for the night.
