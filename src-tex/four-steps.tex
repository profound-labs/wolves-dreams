\PoemTitle{Four Steps in the Desert}

\hspace{2em}\emph{for Chandra}

\begin{verse}
Four steps in the desert --\\
a strange bird singing\\
neo-romantic hymns to the night.

On the other scale the world\\
holds the balance,\\
knowing precisely the weight\\
of our wounds.

Four steps in the desert --\\
it is the longing we desire,\\
not the pictures on the wall\\
of an imagined future.

If I were a house,\\
I would have no walls;\\
if I were a bush,\\
only my roots would endure;\\
if I were a river,\\
in my depths the stones would roll\\
against any law.

Four steps in the desert --\\
a nocturne in search\\
of the lost direction:\\
the true way\\
strays off the path.
\end{verse}
