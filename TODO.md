bi lingual English and German on opposite pages
~120pp, with end notes

- Font types and sizes as in When Everything Is Said.
- German originals should consistently run on left page, English versions on right page.
 - Page numbers for content list will have to be filled in.
- Page numbers for notes will have to be adjusted.
- Cover page also as with When Everything Is Said, except for colour. At the moment I envision white writing on dark blue cover. 
 - ISBN number will have to be added.
